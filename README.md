# üì∞ **Fake News Detection with Machine Learning**

Welcome to the **Fake News Detection** project by **MufakirAnsari**! This repository contains an advanced machine learning solution to classify news articles as either **REAL** or **FAKE** using Python and cutting-edge techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

In today's world, where misinformation spreads rapidly through social media and online platforms, detecting fake news has become crucial. This project aims to empower users to distinguish between real and fake news by leveraging the power of machine learning.

## üåü **Features of the Project**

- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** with **n-grams** to convert raw text into meaningful numerical features.
- **State-of-the-Art Model**: Implements a **PassiveAggressiveClassifier**, optimized for high accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Achieved **94% cross-validation accuracy** using **GridSearchCV** with the best parameters:
  - `clf__C`: 0.1
  - `clf__max_iter`: 50
  - `tfidf__ngram_range`: (1, 2)
- **Comprehensive Analysis**:
  - **Feature Importance**: Identifies the most impactful words in distinguishing real from fake news.
  - **Error Analysis**: Analyzes misclassified examples to understand model weaknesses.
  - **Word Clouds**: Visualizes the most frequent words in real and fake news.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Includes **ROC-AUC Curves**, **Precision-Recall Curves**, and **Confusion Matrices** for detailed evaluation.
- **Extensible**: Designed to be extended into an interactive dashboard using tools like **Streamlit** or **Dash**.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
```

### **Dataset**
The project uses the **Fake News Dataset**, which contains labeled news articles. You can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1er9NJTLUA3qnRuyhfzuN0XUsoIC4a-_q/view). Place the `news.csv` file in the same directory as the script.

### **Running the Code**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MufakirAnsari/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python fakenews.py
   ```
